# CPP makes sad

**Turbo C++** is to blame here. _(It's what they asked me to use at school. Sigh.)_

* * *

## Projects

### Semyorka
* HTML Parser written in Turbo C++
* Semyorka was the name of the rocket that carried **Sputnik** to space
* It won me an award though. :P

### Sputnik
* The C++ based browser I had hoped to write atop **Semyorka**.
* You don't see it here because I gave up after struggling with inline css.

### Helicopter
* The Pointless command line C++ game.
* **Statutory Warning** : Highly addictive. You may also experience withdrawal symptoms.

### Circle
* My first serious attempt at writing a C++ program.
* Draws some circles on the screen.
* It appears here for emotional reasons. Please bear with me. Sob.
